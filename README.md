# Overview 
![](assets/main.png)
**Geometry Forcing (GF) Overview.**
(a) Our proposed GF paradigm enhances video diffusion models by aligning with geometric features from VGGT~\citep{wang2025vggt}. 
(b) Compared to DFoT~\citep{dfot}, our method generates more temporally and geometrically consistent videos. 
(c) While baseline features fail to reconstruct meaningful 3D geometry, GF-learned features enable accurate 3D reconstruction.

# ðŸš€News

# ðŸ’ªGet Started 

## Setup Environments 

```shell
conda create -n geometryforcing python=3.10 -y
conda activate geometryforcing
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Connect to Weights & Biases:

We use Weights & Biases for logging. [Sign up](https://wandb.ai/login?signup=true) if you don't have an account, and *modify `wandb.entity` in `config.yaml` to your user/organization name*.

## Download Checkpoints and Data
1. Download pretrained checkpiont using huggingface: 
```shell
bash scripts/hf_download_checkpoints.sh
```


2. Download pretrained checkpiont using modelscope:
